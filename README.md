- 👋 Hi, I’m @EllieAlavi
👀 I’m interested in software development, problem-solving, and building impactful projects.
🌱 I’m currently learning full-stack development at Ada Developers Academy (Cohort 23).
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on beginner-friendly projects, open-source contributions, and anything that helps me grow as a developer.
😄 Pronouns: She/Her
⚡ Fun fact: I started my coding journey recently, but I love the challenge of solving puzzles and debugging!
